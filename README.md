Pendo - home assignment 

Hi Alex,
please see my project at the following link:
I'm sorry, that it took too much time, but I just couldn't find too much free time to sit ont the task.
Some notes because of that (not a lot of time):
  - I haven't used Docker.
  - Lack of docker means, you'll have to build the db tables and insert some data. See the script create_tables_and_insert_data.sql
  - The tests I've done, are pretty basic (not full integration tests as recommanded).
  - I used Postman to make rest request to the api. I exported the postman-collection I've used microblog.postman_collection.json
